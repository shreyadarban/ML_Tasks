Project Title: Movie Recommendation System and Iris Flower Classification using scikit-learn

Project Overview:
This project entails building two machine learning models using scikit-learn: a Movie Recommendation System and an Iris Flower Classification system. The recommendation system will utilize K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for collaborative filtering, while the classification system will employ Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for iris flower classification.

1. Movie Recommendation System:
   - Utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on their past preferences.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets, and evaluate the model's performance using accuracy or other appropriate metrics.

2. Iris Flower Classification:
   - Employ the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithm and (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flowers into different species based on their features.
   - Split the iris dataset into training and testing sets, and evaluate the model's performance using accuracy or other appropriate metrics.

Project Steps:
1. Data Collection: Obtain datasets for movie ratings and iris flower features.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the datasets to handle missing values and irrelevant features.
3. Model Development:
   - Implement KNN algorithm for movie recommendation and SVC algorithm for iris flower classification using scikit-learn.
   - Train the models using the training datasets.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of both models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. Model Tuning: Fine-tune the models by adjusting hyperparameters to optimize performance.
6. Documentation: Document the project including dataset descriptions, methodologies, and implementation details.

By completing this project, i have  gained practical experience in building machine learning models for recommendation systems and classification tasks using scikit-learn.
